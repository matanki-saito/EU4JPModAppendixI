Justifications due to calculation errors. Then the promises. Promises of it actually being the next day, and then the next day, and the next one. People started not believing the words of those that had led them there. They started opening their eyes and realizing that they were not 'saints', that they were not going to be 'saved'. Jesus was not coming down from heaven, at least not yet.\n\nWhat started as disbelief quickly turned into hate towards the ones that had misguided them. The masses stormed the government buildings, dragging out the leaders that not long ago they had followed. They were dragged out of their offices and into public squares, and then condemned, criticized and accused. Finally, in most cases they were executed, imprisoned the rest. None could escape the ire of the vengeful masses."

 flavor_jap.63.d:0 "The Edo Period, historically starting in 1603 with the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, marks a time of great stability, prosperity and economic growth for Japan. Finally free of internal struggles and constant civil wars, Japanese focus shifted instead towards the development not only of the economy but also of the arts and sciences. The increase in population saw also an increase in urbanization, which furthered such developments even more.\n\nThe period saw the creation and proliferation of new financial policies, new painting techniques like the ukiyo-e or new entertaining activities like the geisha or the kabuki and even new kinds of dishes like sushi or tempura. They all flourished during the Edo Period and became a staple of the Japanese culture recognized as such all over the world.\n\nWith this unprecedented period of stability, development and growth, our country is sure to be able to reach heights never before imagined."

Instead, He toiled continuously, using His influences to secure favors and support.\n\nWith time, He managed to secure enough support to be able to force the Shogun to abolish the shogunate and re-instate the Imperial Line as the effective ruler of Japan.

The most common form of entertainment in the pleasure districts, performed by men and women alike, was dancing and singing accompanied by instruments and teenage dancing girls called odoriko. When these girls grew up they adopted different names to continue working, one of these names being 'geisha'.\n\nIn time, geisha became to be appreciated for their art with song, dances and the shamisen, and became specialized in these kinds of entertainment."

 flavor_jap.69.t:0 "江戸時代の詩歌"
 flavor_jap.69.d:0 "The prosperity of the Edo period allowed for an equal development and maturity of culture and entertainment, and especially many forms of theater and music appeared. Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened. A specific style of music and metric was created during this time, named kouta or kinsei kouta-cho, and it was so influential that it still persists in folk music to this day. It was a style of music for the shamisen, a banjo-like instrument, designed to accompany the singing of a poem or a story.\n\nPoetry also went through its own period of development, with traditional styles being revived and expanded, and new ones being created. It was very common to write poetry in collaboration with other people while alternating stanzas, and even ordinary citizens began participating in that. The starting stanza of the chain began to be perceived as a poem in itself, which with time gave rise to the haiku.\n\nOld pond;\nfrog leaps in;\nwater sound."

 flavor_jap.73.d:0 "Originally serving as female bushi, the Onna-musha were esteemed warriors in the early days of our Empire. They were members of the samurai class in feudal Japan and were trained in the use of weapons to protect their household, family, and honor in times of war. Over time, they distinguished themselves in the battlefield as able commanders, scoring impressive victories and cementing their names in the books of history.\n\nHowever, because of the influence of Edo neo-Confucianism, the status of the Onna-musha began diminishing significantly. The function of Onna-musha changed in addition to their husbands. Samurai were no longer concerned with battles and war, they were bureaucrats. Women, specifically daughters of most upper class households, were soon pawns to dreams of success and power. The roaring ideals of fearless devotion and selflessness were gradually replaced by quiet, passive, civil obedience. Despite this, many still wish to serve the nation's military forces as commanders and humbly request to be allowed to lay their lives in service of our country's noble cause. One notable example of the female bushi icons is Ohori Tsuruhime. She has courageously been to battle several times and her claim to divine inspiration coupled with fighting skills has led to her being compared with the likes of Joan of Arc. Her legacy will surely establish her as one of the most recognizable female warriors in Japanese history."

 flavor_spa.18.d:1 "The Infantes of Aragon are the sons and daughters of king Fernando I of Aragon and his wife Leonor de Alburquerque, who established the Trastámara dynasty in that kingdom after the Compromise of Caspe in 1412. They are also cousins of the Castilian king Juan II and conspired since early in his reign to control him and seize power in Castile, with the support of a faction of relatives and allies among the Castilian nobility. However, they were opposed by another faction headed by the Royal Constable Álvaro de Luna, who became the main support of king Juan II for two decades.\n\nThe situation deteriorated from 1437 when a new civil war broke out between the faction headed by the Infantes of Aragon, and the one headed by Álvaro de Luna and the heir to the throne Enrique, which came to a resolution at the Battle of Olmedo in [GetYear]."

The maravedí, the main currency of account, had been continually devalued since the 13th century. In addition, there were different regional currencies in the Iberian kingdoms, which complicated the economics of the political unification initiated by the wedding of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\n For this reason, a monetary reform was initiated in [GetYear], establishing a new gold coin, the ducat, and a new silver coin, the real, for use in both kingdoms. Given the unexpectedly large influx of silver coming from the Americas in the following decades, the use of the 'real de a ocho', which soon became widely known as the 'Spanish dollar', skyrocketed. It is considered the first global currency, since it was accepted by merchants all over the world, from Africa to America and from Europe to Asia."
