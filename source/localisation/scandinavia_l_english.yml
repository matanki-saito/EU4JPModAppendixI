The Kalmar Union - the very hungry Lions of the North - seek our subjugation. The Lithuanians, backed by their Polish allies, want to annex the Baltic lands, and the Novgorodians to our east consider expanding westwards.\nBut that is not all. In 1435, the bishoprics formed the Livonian Confederacy under the rule of Riga, and started steering precious resources away from us for their own gain.\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. Times change, and the Livonian Order is at the crossroads of destiny.

After a visit to the region in 1364, the French crusader Philippe de Mézières wrote: \"Two months a year, that is in September and October, the herring travel from one sea to the other through the Sound, by order of God, in such large numbers that it is a great wonder, and so many pass through the sound in these months, that at several places one can cut them with a dagger.\" \n\nEmbarking on the market as a competitor to Skane would probably prove to be very profitable.

Since then, the League lost its touch and the offices were granted to other local and foreign merchants. \n\nAround [GetYear], an office of the Hanseatic League was established in Bryggen. As the town developed into an important trading centre, the wharfs were improved and the buildings of Bryggen were gradually taken over by the Hanseatic merchants.

 flavor_hsa.8.d:0 "Visby lies on the Island of Gotland, about 100 km east of the mainland in the Baltic Sea. The settlement, dating from the Viking Age, was formed on a shore with a natural harbour, sheltered by steep cliff formations. Gotlandic merchants utilized it as a strategic point in trade within the Baltic Sea. They allied for the protection of their trading posts which developed into a federation or Hansa. By the 12th century Visby had come to dominate this trade, and all the commercial routes of the Baltic were channelled through the town. After the foundation of Lübeck in 1143, German merchants began to expand their sphere of interest into the Baltic Sea and settled in Visby. It became the only trading place on the island with the privilege of trading with German towns and hence the main centre of the Hanseatic League. During the 13th century, Visby changed from a seasonal trading place into an impressive metropolis, enclosed by a strong defensive wall and increasingly divorced from its rural hinterland. The wall imposed new restrictions on the Gotlandic traders creating tensions that led to civil war in 1288. German, Russian and Danish traders built stone warehouses in parallel rows from the harbour and the community expanded with guild houses, churches and residences. In the 14th century, Visby began to lose its leading position in the Hanseatic League due to plague around 1350 and invasion by the Danish army under King Valdemar Atterdag in 1361. Warfare and piracy in the 15th century and changed trading routes bypassing Visby severely affected trade on Gotland and the economy of Visby deteriorated. However, the recent reacquisition of Gotland by the Hanseatic Merchants will surely breathe a gust of fresh air throughout the island's markets and beyond."

It was based on the basis of an earlier similar organization, the Lizard Union established in 1397 by Chełmno Land nobles. \n\nIn 1454, the leader of the Confederation, Johannes von Baysen (Jan Bazynski), formally asked King Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland as a fief. This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War between the Order's State and Poland, with the Prussian cities financing the military costs of the latter. \n\nDespite the conflicts between the aforementioned parties, Danzig now lies within our sphere of influence. As a result, the merchants of the City and members of the Confederation have come to our court in Lubeck to barter and ask for access to our prosperous markets."

Our League houses merchants from all over Europe and they meet annually to make decisions as 43 of the 67 Hanseatic Days (Hansetage) took place in Lübeck, which was positioned geographically favorable. This resulted in us taking the leading role in the Hanseatic League. The hub of power was the Town Hall erected in [GetYear] which serves as the central assembly and deliberation chamber for matters of the League. It is one of the most famous Gothic brickwork structures. With its impressive facade, it resembles a fairytale castle. The shape of the building has been defined over three centuries: from 1226 to even today, a succession of new elements were added, and there were conversions and extensions such as the sandstone arcade, the raising of the striking facade with its distinctive circular holes for improved wind resistance as well as the bay window and impressive grand staircase."

In particular, the Holstentor is split into 3 layers: the Inner, Middle and Outer Gates. Each was built as a response to the advances of gunpowder and siege equipment, the latest addition of fortifications will surely be adequate and proven to be a sound investment for the safeguard of our wealth. \n\nThe Burgtor is the oldest of the four former gates of the medieval city fortifications of Lübeck. At the end of the Große Burgstraße, located at the northern end of the historic old town of Lübeck, you will find the castle gate, which was built in the late Gothic style. In addition to the more famous Holsten Gate, the Burgtor is the second largest city gate of the Lübeck city fortifications. The Lübeck Castle Gate takes its name from the old Lübeck Castle high above the Trave, which was converted into a castle monastery in 1227."

Merchants and the government work together to reduce the trade deficit and create a surplus. Mercantilism, a form of economic nationalism, funds corporate, military, and national growth. It advocates trade policies that protect domestic industries. In mercantilism, the government strengthens the private owners of the factors of production. \n\nThese four factors of production are entrepreneurship, capital goods, natural resources and labor. Mercantilism establishes monopolies, grants tax free status, and grants pensions to favoured industries. It imposes tariffs on imports. It also prohibits the emigration of skilled labor, capital, and tools. It doesn't allow anything that could help foreign companies. In return, businesses funnel the riches from foreign expansion back to their governments. Its taxes pay for increase national growth and political power."

 flavor_hsa.13.d:1 "The Hansa used a ship called the cog for sea transport. It was a bulky freighter with one mast and a square sail. A helm at the stern and a flat floor made it possible to ship in low water. Unlike the Nordic longboats they were more economical to use. A cog could transport a relatively large amount of cargo with just a small crew, up to 90 tons. It was produced relatively quickly and inexpensively at that time. \n\nLarger loads could be transported more cheaply and by a smaller crew than previously. That's what made this type of ship so successful. There were cogs of different sizes, between 15 and 25 m in length, 5-8 m wide and with a moulded depth of 3-5 m. The measurement of the capacity of a cog was called “last”, equivalent to 2 tons. This was the capacity of a carriage drawn by four horses. A small cog of 50 last was able to carry the same load as an endless convoy of 50 waggons pulled by 200 horses. There were also cogs twice as big. With the castle (aft) the surroundings could be observed well. Due to the lack of keel, the cog could also fall to ground during low tide, but it was also restricted to navigate because of that. A cog could only ride with the wind and not cross the wind."

The war galleon was built by Lübeck during the Northern Seven Years' War to escort her convoy of merchant ships in the Baltic and North Sea. \n\nSuch naval prowess displayed by Adler will certainly be the object of envy in the eyes of our rivals.

 flavor_hsa.25.d:0 "Hans Holbein (the Younger) was a German painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style, and is considered one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called \"the Younger\" to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school. \n\nHolbein was born in Augsburg, but he worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first, he painted murals and religious works, designed stained glass windows, and printed books. He also painted an occasional portrait, making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. When the Reformation reached Basel, Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons. His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, as well as by Renaissance humanism. The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own. \n\nHolbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work, with a recommendation from Erasmus. He was welcomed into the humanist circle of Thomas More, where he quickly built a high reputation. He returned to Basel for four years, then resumed his career in England in 1532 under the patronage of Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell. By 1535, he was King's Painter to Henry VIII of England. In this role, he produced portraits and festive decorations, as well as designs for jewellery, plate, and other precious objects. His portraits of the royal family and nobles are a record of the court in the years when Henry was asserting his supremacy over the Church of England. \nHolbein's art was prized from early in his career. French poet and reformer Nicholas Bourbon (the elder) dubbed him \"the Apelles of our time,\" a typical accolade at the time. Holbein has also been described as a great \"one-off\" of art history, since he founded no school. Some of his work was lost after his death, but much was collected, and he was recognised among the great portrait masters by the 19th century. Recent exhibitions have also highlighted his versatility. He created designs ranging from intricate jewellery to monumental frescoes. \n\nHolbein's art has sometimes been called realist, since he drew and painted with a rare precision. His portraits were renowned in their time for their likeness, and it is through his eyes that many famous figures of his day are pictured today, such as Erasmus and More. He was never content with outward appearance, however; he embedded layers of symbolism, allusion, and paradox in his art, to the lasting fascination of scholars. In the view of art historian Ellis Waterhouse, his portraiture \"remains unsurpassed for sureness and economy of statement, penetration into character, and a combined richness and purity of style\"."
