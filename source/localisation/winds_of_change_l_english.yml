 flavor_ven.42.d:0 "The Carnival of Venice in the 15th century is a vibrant and extravagant event known for its opulent masks and costumes. It lasts for several weeks leading up to Lent, providing a temporary escape from societal norms.

 flavor_ven.43.d:0 "The history of the Venice Carnival dates back to the 11th century when it began as a celebration of the Venetian Republic's victory over its enemies. Over time, the Carnival evolved into a grand and unique event, gaining popularity in the 15th century. During this period, Venice's status as a major trading hub in Europe allowed it to accumulate considerable wealth. This prosperity fueled the extravagance of the Carnival. It became a symbol of Venice's opulence and decadence, attracting visitors from all over Europe who were eager to participate in the masked festivities. The masks worn during the Carnival not only provided anonymity but also served as a way to erase social distinctions, allowing people from different backgrounds to mingle freely during the celebrations.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Venice Carnival reached its zenith, characterized by elaborate costumes, theatrical performances, and intricate mask designs. However, in 1797, the Carnival was banned by the occupying French forces, and it remained dormant for nearly two centuries. It wasn't until the late 20th century that the Carnival was revived, becoming the internationally renowned event it is today. Today's Venice Carnival preserves the traditions of the past, featuring stunning masks and costumes, street performances, and a vibrant atmosphere, making it a captivating and nostalgic journey into the city's rich history and culture."

Originally conceived as a fortress-like edifice, the palace evolved over time into a magnificent representation of Venetian Gothic architecture. This architectural marvel served the dual purpose of being both the residence of the Doge, the preeminent political leader of the Venetian Republic and housing various government offices and courts.\n\nBy the 16th century, the Doge's Palace had undergone substantial renovations and expansions, resulting in a significant augmentation of its grandeur. One of the most remarkable developments was the completion of its iconic façade, which faced the Grand Canal, showcasing the palace's architectural splendor to all who approached by water. This period of renovation and expansion further solidified the palace's status as an enduring symbol of Venetian power and authority. Its halls and chambers, characterized by intricate designs and opulent decorations, not only bore witness to centuries of political activities but also stood as an enduring testament to the city's rich history and continued significance on the global stage."

The city was home to some of the earliest permanent theaters in Europe, such as the Teatro di San Cassiano, which opened in 1637, and the Teatro Olimpico, designed by Andrea Palladio in 1580. These venues hosted a wide range of theatrical performances, including plays, operas, and comedies, attracting both locals and tourists. Venice's unique position as a major maritime and trading hub allowed for the exchange of artistic ideas and influences from across Europe, contributing to the development of Venetian theater as a rich and diverse form of entertainment that played a pivotal role in the history of European drama and performance arts."

Figures like Girolamo Brusoni and Ferrante Pallavicino, among others, are associated with this covert group, marked by its use of subterfuges like paradox and allegory to avoid criticism. Operating discreetly, members often employ secret language and publish anonymously, with their philosophy influenced by Trajano Boccalini, embracing Aristotelian naturalism from the University of Padua.\n This clandestine academy, despite facing censorship and finding its works on the Index, boldly challenges societal norms through satirical compositions and hybrid genres. Shaped by the ideologies of Machiavelli, Paolo Sarpi, and others, they critique tyranny in historical writings. Surprisingly, the Accademia degli Incogniti becomes a key force in advancing musical theatre in Venice, establishing the Teatro Novissimo."

Over time, the promissione became increasingly comprehensive and was eventually printed, with documents for different Doges growing in length, ranging from 108 to 301 pages. To prevent the office from becoming hereditary, restrictions extended to the Doge's relatives, barring them from certain councils and positions. Although some restrictions were eased in the later years of the Venetian Republic, significant limitations remained in place, even for the Doge's family members. The oaths also included provisions regarding the Dogaressa, including her attire and ceremonial duties."

His contributions to art come in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that we have eloquently dubbed the [Root.GetAdjective] Golden Age, when [Root.GetAdjective] art (especially [Root.GetAdjective] painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, has become extremely prolific and innovative and is giving rise to important new genres."

Her upbringing in the vibrant cultural milieu of Naples instilled in her a deep appreciation for the arts and humanities. Beatrice's marriage to Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in 1476 cemented her role as a key diplomatic figure in Renaissance Europe. Through her patronage, she fostered a thriving cultural exchange between Italy and Hungary, facilitating the transfer of artistic ideas, manuscripts, and scholars. In Hungary, Beatrice established a renowned court library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, which became a center for humanist learning and scholarship. Her patronage supported the work of prominent humanist writers and scholars, contributing to the intellectual flourishing of the Renaissance. Beyond her cultural endeavors, Beatrice played a crucial role in diplomatic affairs, acting as an intermediary between Italian city-states and Hungarian interests.

He saw a land, a limitless land that he sought to conquer. The man's name is Moctezuma I, the second Emperor of the Aztec Empire. Although in the past the title of Emperor was only ceremonial, he transformed it into a proper title through the subjugation of his neighbors, as well as military crackdown of the other members of the alliance.\n\nWith this recent shift in power, he can now start chasing his dream. There are many threats around him, such as the Purepecha Empire, the Tlaxcalan Senate, the remnants of the Zapotec, and even the disunited Mayan lands. There are many foes that threaten to stop this dream, but we shall conquer even Mictlan for him."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] is now the sole ruler of the cities around Lake Texcoco.\n\nWith this newfound peace in our lands, the banners are slowly being raised again.

Conflict, as the God Tezcatlipoca promotes, is the source of blood.\n\nAll of this is not enough. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that even in victory, we must celebrate with more blood.

He led a plethora of new reforms as he ended his conflicts with the Tlaxcala alliance. As he split the clouds in half, he created an administration to rule over the numerous city-states in Mexico. With his conquests of the Mayan people, he strengthened the religious character all around the realm, increasing the amount of blood offered to the Gods.

 flavor_tim.5.d:0 "In 1436, the Iraqi-born Theologian, Muhammad ibn Falah, began his rise to power. Claiming to be an earthly representative of Ali and Mahdi, he gathered a sizeable following among the local tribes, eventually taking his chances and seizing the city of Hoveyzeh. Since then, his Musha'sha has been nothing but a thorn in our side, trying to claim more and more of our territory while spouting their Millenarist delusions.

However, with the Timurid Empire on the rise again, the fate of the Black Sheep tribal federation has been sealed.

 flavor_tim.8.d:1 "Recent decades have followed a most worrisome trend.

Thankfully, we were able to punish those miscreants and bring these territories back under our control.
